# Oryx Labs

This repository provides a sandbox for trying out new stuff and use it in an [Oryx](https://github.com/spryker/oryx) application. The components provided here are not guaranteed to work perfectly, nor are they always updated to the latest versions. They are provided for demo purposes only, and we recommend using them in a non-production environment.

The reason to keep this work in a separate repository is two-fold:

1. we like to keep this work lean and free from strict development rules. The rules and pipeline on the Oryx repository are quit strict which will impact the agility of this work, which will negatively impact the development of demo's
2. we like to allow for additional dependencies which can be convenient to use. The Oryx repository is however keen to add the minimum amount of dependencies.

Some of the work done in this repository can be considered incubation and might eventually land in [the main repository](https://github.com/spryker/oryx).

## Disclaimer

You are free to use these components in your own projects, demos, or experiments. However, please keep in mind that these components are experimental and are not suitable for use in production environments.
